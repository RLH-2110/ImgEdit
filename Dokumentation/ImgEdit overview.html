	<h1>TODO</h1>
	
	ImgEdit is a project to create and edit .img disk image files, specifically for fat12 floppy disks.<br/>
	orginally it was planned for it to be able to convert ZIP files into IMG files, but that got delayed to when the core funktionality is done.<br/>
	<br/>
    ImgEdit is divied into 3 (technically 4) projects: <br/>
	<a href="./Core/index_core.html">the core DLL</a>, 	<a href="./Console/index_console.html">the console version</a>, and the <a href="./Window/index_window.html">window version</a> (not to be confused with windows version)<br/>
	The 4th projekt is just an undokumented testing project where random code will be tested in isolation.

	<h1>Why is C# used</h1>
	C# was used, because I am working on during my school-like apprenticeship, and we used C# at the time.

	<h1>Notes</h1>
	This documentation will call 'methods' 'functions'
